	The WebSockets tab shows all of the WebSockets requests that have been made by your browser.
	<p>
	If new messages are sent or received after the page loads then the tab will show a count of these messages - 
	if you see that keeps going up then that you will know that the page is still sending or receiving them.
	<p>
	You can click on the tab or on the arrow button on the right-hand side to show and hide the list of the messages,
	and you can click on any of the messages to see the full details.
	<p>
	WebSocket messages can either be text or binary. Once you have selected a text message you will also be able to replay
	the request with any changes to the contents that you like. This is not currently supported for binary messages.
