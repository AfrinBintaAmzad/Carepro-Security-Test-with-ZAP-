	ZAP Scripts are a powerful way to take full advantage of ZAP. 
	They can be used to create custom scans, generate alerts, generate payloads for fuzzing and much more.
	<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts">A few example scripts from the community can be found here</a>
	</p>
	The Toggle Script tool allows you to select a script and toggle it on and off.
	<p>
	It is not shown by default so you will need to add it to a panel as described in the Tool Configuration tutorial page.
	<p>
	Once added, you can either right- or left-click on the Select Script icon <img src="script-add.png" alt="[scroll with plus]"> to select a script.
	<p>
	After selecting a script, you will see its current status:
	<ul>
		<li>Enabled: <img src="script-enabled.png" alt="[scroll with green check]"></li>
		<li>Disabled: <img src="script-disabled.png" alt="[scroll with red x]"></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	By left-clicking, you can toggle the script to its opposite state. For example, an Enabled <img src="script-enabled.png" alt="enabled"> script will become Disabled <img src="script-disabled.png" alt="disabled">
	<p>
	By right-clicking, you can either change the script or remove this tool from the panel as described in the Tool Configuration tutorial page.
