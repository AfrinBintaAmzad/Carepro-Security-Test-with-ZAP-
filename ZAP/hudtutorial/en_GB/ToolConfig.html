	<h1>Tool Configuration</H1>
	You have control over which tools are shown and where they appear on the side panels.
	<p>
	To add a tool click on the green plus icon <img src="plus.png" alt="[plus]"> at the bottom of either of the side panels. 
	You will be shown a list of all of the tools that are not currently visible. 
	Select one of them for it to be added to the bottom of the relevant panel.
	<p>
	To remove one of the side panel tools, right-click on it. 
	You will be shown a dialog with the option to remove it from the panel along with any other options available for the tool.
	<p>
	You can move tools by removing them and re-adding them in the order you would like. 
	We do plan to implement a drag and drop interface to make this easier!
