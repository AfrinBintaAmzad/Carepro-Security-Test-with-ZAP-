	<h1>HTTPS Upgrade</H1>
	The HUD uses a service worker running on a custom 'zap' domain to communicate with ZAP.
	This will only work on target domains that support HTTPS. <br>
	When the HUD is enabled ZAP will redirect HTTP sites to HTTPS.
	If they do not support HTTPS then ZAP will handle the HTTP upgrade internally so that the browser communicates
	with ZAP via HTTPS while ZAP forwards the requests to the target over HTTP.
	<p>
	Most applications should be unaffected by the HTTPS upgrade, but if your application is broken by it then please report this as an issue
	supplying as many details as you can. 
	<p>
	You can configure ZAP to only enable the HUD for domains that are in scope. 
	This is only available via the ZAP desktop as by default no domains are in scope and therefore the HUD will not be available until the first domain is added.
